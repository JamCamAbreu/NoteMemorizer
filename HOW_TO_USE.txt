-- HOW TO USE: NoteMemorizer, By James Cam Abreu --
(inspired by studying for MCSD certification exams)

• MCSD format: lots of questions that 
  - involve keywords 
  - names of programs or functions
  - involves a lot of rote-memorization
	

• examtopics.com/exams/microsoft
  - More accurate than other sources for MCSD
  - Has all tests for MCSD
	

• Note taking
  - Taking notes manually instead of just looking at questions can help us remember better
  - The process of organizing notes: more to come
	

• Note Memorizer Application:
  1. Download the source code (github.com/JamCamAbreu/NoteMemorizer)
  2. ‘build’ it in Visual Studio
  3. Create or copy-in your note/.txt file into noteFiles folder (in bin, not source)
    - if you do not yet have a note/.txt text file: see recommended study pattern below	
    - if you want to debug your notes: put in source noteFiles folder, 
    - and in the properties of that text file make sure to select "Copy always" 
    - from the "Copy to Output Directory" Build action
  4. Double check your note/txt file’s notation (look at ‘template.txt’ included in source)
  5. Run the console app (in visual studios, or by ‘publishing’ the app to exe)
    - if you don't see your file listed, check to make sure you copied it into the bin's 
    - noteFiles folder, or (see about debugging above)


• Recommended Study Pattern:

  1. Read each question carefully on examtopics.com. Try to answer the question as best you can.

  2. Reveal the answer, see if you were correct

  3. Think about what kind of broad category this question could be organized into 
    (helps your mind package away questions into topics, makes it easier to remember)

  4. If that topic doesn’t exist in your notes yet, create it (use ~ for topic, see template)

  5. Copy and paste the question to your Note-Memorizer notes as a question (use # for question)

  6. Instead of copying the answer, manually type out the answer into your notes (use * for answer)

  7. Think about what words in the answer are important, insert the ^ symbol in front of them

  8. After you’ve collected enough questions from examtopics, play the Note-Memorizer application 
    several times, first starting with the keyword-first-few-letters mode, and then doing keyword-full mode

  9. Once confident, go back to examtopics, and see how much more accurately and quickly you can pass the test.
