~ Topic 2: Develop for Azure storage (15% to 20%)

	# You should be able to...DEVELOP SOLUTIONS THAT USE AZURE COSMOS DB
		* Perform operations on containers and items by using the ^SDK
		* Set the appropriate ^consistency level for operations
		* Implement ^change ^feed notifications

	# You should be able to...DEVELOP SOLUTIONS THAT USE AZURE BLOB STORAGE
		* Set and retrieve ^properties and metadata
		* Perform operations on data by using the appropriate SDK
		* Implement storage ^policies and data ^lifecycle management
		* Implement ^static website hosting


	# BLOB stands for:
		* ^Binary
		* ^Large
		* ^OBject

	# Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. 
		* Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of ^unstructured data. 
		* ^Unstructured data is data that doesn't adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data

	# Blob storage is designed for:
		* Serving images or documents directly to a browser
		* Storing files for ^distributed access
		* ^Streaming video and audio
		* Writing to log files
		* Storing data for ^backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving
		* Storing data for ^analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service

	# Users or client applications can access objects in Blob storage via HTTP/HTTPS, from anywhere in the world. 
		* Objects in Blob storage are accessible via: 
			- the Azure Storage ^REST API
			- Azure ^PowerShell
			- Azure CLI
			- an Azure Storage client library

	# Blob Storage Accounts: Performance Tiers
		* ^Standard: This is the general-purpose v2 account and is recommended for most scenarios using Azure Storage

		* ^Premium: offer higher performance by using solid-state drives. 
			Additionally, you can choose between three account types: 
				- block blobs
				- page blobs 
				- file shares

	# Access Tiers for Blob Storage:
		* The ^Hot access tier
			- optimized for FREQUENT access of objects in the storage account
			- Highest storage costs, but the lowest access costs
			- New storage accounts are created in this tier by default

		* The ^Cool access tier
			- optimized for storing large amounts of data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days
			- Lower storage costs and higher access costs

		* The ^Cold access tier
			- optimized for storing data that is INFREQUENTLY accessed and stored for a minimum of 90 days. 
			- has lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to the cool tier.

		* The ^Archive tier
			- optimized for data that can tolerate several hours of retrieval latency and remains in the tier for at least 180 days
			- the most cost-effective option for storing data
			- however, ACCESSING that data is more expensive
