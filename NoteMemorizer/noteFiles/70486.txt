# You are designing an HTML5 website. You need to design the interface to make
  the content of the web page viewable in all types of browsers, including
  voice recognition software, screen readers, and reading pens. What should you do?

* Annotate HTML5 content elements with Accessible Rich Internet Application (^ARIA) attributes.
* Ensure that HTML5 content elements have valid and descriptive names.
* Use HTML5 ^semantic markup elements to enhance the pages.

  (Each correct answer presents a complete solution. Choose all that apply.)

* Use ^HTML5 ^semantic markup elements.
* Annotate content elements with ^Accessible ^Rich ^Internet ^Application (ARIA) attributes.





~ Deploy, Publishing, and Azure

# You are developing an ASP.NET MVC web application in Visual Studio 2012. The
  application requires several thousand content files. All content is hosted on
  the same IIS instance as the application. You detect performance issues when
  the application starts. You need to resolve the performance issues.

* Combine the content files by using ASP.NET MVC ^bundling

# You are designing a distributed application that runs on the Microsoft Azure
  platform. The application must store a small amount of information that is
  shared cross all users and does not change frequently. You need to configure
  the application to meet the requirements. Which server-side state management
  option should you use? (Each correct answer presents a complete solution.
  Choose all that apply.)

* ^SQL Database







~ Error Handling and Unit Testing

# You are authoring unit tests.
  The unit tests must test code that consumes sealed classes.
  You need to create, maintain, and inject dependencies in the unit tests.
  Which isolation method should you use?

* ^Shim types

# You are testing an ASP.NET application.
  The test plan requires that tests run against the application's business layer.
  You need to use the test project template that meets this requirement.
  Which template should you use?

* ^Unit Test Project

# You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application by using Visual Studio 2012.
  The application throws and handles exceptions when it runs.
  You need to examine the state of the application when exceptions are thrown.
  What should you do?

* From the Debug menu in Visual Studio 2012, select Exceptions.
  (enable/disable?) ^Enable the ^thrown check box for Common Language Runtime Exceptions.








~ State and Sessions

# You are developing an ASP.NET MVC news aggregation application that will be
  deployed to servers on multiple networks. The application must be compatible
  with multiple browsers. A user can search the website for news articles. You
  must track the page number that the user is viewing in search results. You
  need to program the location for storing state information about the user's
  search. What should you do?

* Use ^QueryString to store search terms and page index

# You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application. The application is deployed in
  a web farm and is accessed by many users. The application must handle web
  server failures gracefully. The servers in the farm must share the short-term
  state information. You need to persist the application state during the
  session. What should you implement?

* A ^state ^server

  search results. You need to program the location for storing state
  information. Where should you persist state information?

* ^QueryString

* ^state server

# You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application that displays stock market
  information. The stock market information updates frequently and must be
  displayed in real-time. You need to eliminate unnecessary header data,
  minimize latency, and transmit data over a full-duplex connection. What
  should you do?

* Implement ^WebSockets protocol on the client and the server.

# You are designing a distributed application. The application must store a
  small amount of insecure global information that does not change frequently.
  You need to configure the application to meet the requirements. Which
  server-side state management option should you use?

  (Each correct answer presents a complete solution. Choose all that apply.)

* ^Application state
* ^Database support








~ Security, Authentication, and Validation

# You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application. You need to authenticate
  clients by using NT LAN Manager (NTLM). Which authentication method should
  you implement?

* ^Windows


# You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application. The application must allow
  users to enter JavaScript in a feedback text box only. You need to disable
  request validation. What should you do?

* Use the ^HttpRequest.Unvalidated property to read the unvalidated form value.

  - The ^HttpRequest.Unvalidated property gets the HTTPrequest values without
    triggering request validation.


# You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application that will be deployed on a web
  farm. Passwords must be stored in the web.config file and must not be
  readable or in a format that is easily decodable You need to encrypt the
  passwords that are stored in the web.config file. Which command-line tool
  should you use?

* ^Aspnet_regiis.exe
