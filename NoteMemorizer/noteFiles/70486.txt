    You need to complete the ASP.NET SignalR implementation.
    Which three steps should you perform?

    * Create a ^hub class to push content to clients

    * Use the ^SignalR ^jQuery library in a web page to send messages to
      the ^hub and display updates from the ^hub

    * Map a ^SignalR ^hub to the app builder pipeline by using
      an ^OWIN startup class

  # You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application that will be deployed on
    local Internet Information Services (IIS) servers and on an Azure Web Role.
    You must log events for the application when it is deployed locally and on
    Azure. You must not deploy additional services. You need to implement a
    logging solution. Which two technologies can you use?

    * ^event ^log
    * ^trace



  # You develop an ASP.NET MVC application. The application includes a web
    application configuration file that contains sensitive information. You
    need to encrypt the sensitive information.
    Which tool should you use?

    * ^aspnet_regis.exe
      - You can use the ASP.NET ^IIS ^Registration Tool (^aspnet_regiis.exe) to
        encrypt or decrypt sections of a Web configuration file.


  # You are maintaining an ASP.NET MVC application that runs on Azure. Remote
    debugging is enabled for this role, but the input endpoints for remote
    debugging have been removed for security reasons. You do not have
    permission to view the Azure Portal for this deployment. You can log on by
    using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). You must attach the input endpoints to
    enable remote debugging. You need to add the input endpoints to enable
    remote debugging. Which file should you modify?

    * E:\<^GUID>.^csman



~ Reports and Business Logic

  # You deploy an ASP.NET MVC Web application to Internet Information Services
    (IIS). The application has a secure area that provides access to custom
    reports. You must develop custom business logic to support the reports. The
    custom business logic has the following requirements:
      - It must run each time that a report is requested.
      - It must not run for other IIS requests.
      - It must be mapped to the request extension of the report.
      - It must be written by using a managed language that is supported by the .NET framework.
      - You must be able to quickly modify and deploy updates to the business logic.
    You need to develop the custom business logic.
    What should you do?

    * Develop a new ^HTTP handler that includes the custom business logic.

    * Deploy the HTTP *handler to IIS
